Chitter Challenge
=================

### About

This Ruby web project has been written using TDD and BDD.  It is a small Twitter clone that allows users to post messages to a public stream. 

The program has met the conditions of the user stories, such as:

- So that I can let people know what I a doing, I want to post a message to chitter.

- So that I can see what others are saying, I want to see all messages in reverse chronological order.

- So that I can appreciate the context of a peep, I want to see the time at which it was made.
